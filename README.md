<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

- Streamlit-based webpage showcasing the my technical skills, academic projects, and fun Python projects. The webpage is divided into different sections, each with its own text container.

- The first section contains a header that includes a subheader, title, and an image. The second section contains information about Chaitannyaa's technical skills, including Cloud computing, Ubuntu, Docker, Kubernetes, and Python. Each skill is described in short, and there is a "Learn More" link that takes the you to my Github Account.

- The third section showcases some animations related to coding and programming. The fourth section contains information about my academic project. It explains how the project designed and implemented a liquid cooling system based on the Thermosyphon principle to improve the performance of CPU processors. There are images of the project, and a link to actual photos.

- Finally, the webpage ends with a container that displays some more animations. This project helps to showcase technical skills, projects and work experiences in a different way !
